# HTML forms

<form> element formally defines a form. It's a container element like a <section> or <footer> element, but specifically for containing forms.

It accepts a number of attributes, but the most important ones are action and method.
The action attribute defines the URL that processes the form. Itâ€™s where the input collected by the form is sent when the user clicks the Submit button. The method attribute can be either post or get, both of which define how the form is submitted to the backend server.
